# Discord Variety Bot
## Purpose
I haven't written this with the purpose of creating a featureful bot or a popular project. Rather, I've done this to help myself learn about rust and programming in general. The github repository exists for a similar reason. I did also enjoy writing the bot, so I do plan to improve/maintain it, at least as long as I find it interesting/worthwhile.

## Features
Currently, the bot only implements 3 functions, but I'll add to them as I go
### Utility:
#### Ping
`~ping`
Self explanitory, you say `~ping`, it says `pong`.
Checks to see if the bot's alive
#### About
`~about`
Gives the name and the version of the bot.
If running a debug build, it'll also let you know that.
### Games:
Only one so far
#### Rock Paper Scissors
`~rps`
Plays rock paper scissors, and accounts, currently, for the majority of the effort that has gone into writing this bot.
